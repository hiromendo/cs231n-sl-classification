CS231N Gesture Recognition
Authors (in random order): Ying Hang Seah, Kenny Leung, Hiroshi Mendoza

We aim to create a gesture recognition algorithm using deep convolutional network and LSTM. 

## Dataset

We are using [Chalearn Isolated Gesture](http://chalearnlap.cvc.uab.es/dataset/21/description/) dataset to train our model. To prepare the dataset, download the dataset from Chalearn.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
