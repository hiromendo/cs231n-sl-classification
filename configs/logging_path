INFO:root:Initializing configuration for experiment <basic_resnet_lstm_classifier> : For the milestone.
Apply a simple pretrained ConvNet architecture to a small sample of
training data (from 10 gesture classes) and use an LSTM network
to process these frame embeddings and feed them into a final softmax
classification output layer.
